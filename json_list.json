Della Robbia is noted for his colorful, tin-glazed terracotta statuary, a technique which he invented and passed on to his nephew Andrea della Robbia and great-nephews Giovanni della Robbia and Girolamo della Robbia. Though a leading sculptor in stone, he worked primarily in terracotta after developing his technique in the early 1440s. His large workshop produced both cheaper works cast from molds in multiple versions, and more expensive one-off individually modeled pieces.<\/p>","cloudinary thumbnails":"https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/dfyzsulq8\/image\/upload\/v1622639726\/thumbnails2\/thumbnail_043_egz9f5.png","final artworks":["https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/dfyzsulq8\/image\/upload\/v1622639726\/thumbnails2\/thumbnail_043_egz9f5.png","https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/dfyzsulq8\/image\/upload\/v1621499134\/artworks\/43_0_zw1lud.png","https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/dfyzsulq8\/image\/upload\/v1621499134\/artworks\/43_1_jo2aqe.png","https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/dfyzsulq8\/image\/upload\/v1622644688\/artworks_rijk\/43_7_qpozpn.png","https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/dfyzsulq8\/image\/upload\/v1622644688\/artworks_rijk\/43_5_wi8xs7.png","https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/dfyzsulq8\/image\/upload\/v1622644688\/artworks_rijk\/43_6_tplwxs.png","https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/dfyzsulq8\/image\/upload\/v1622644688\/artworks_rijk\/43_3_bclj0r.png","https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/dfyzsulq8\/image\/upload\/v1622644688\/artworks_rijk\/43_0_erxfo7.png","https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/dfyzsulq8\/image\/upload\/v1622644688\/artworks_rijk\/43_1_j9dssv.png","https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/dfyzsulq8\/image\/upload\/v1622644688\/artworks_rijk\/43_8_pqzzok.png","https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/dfyzsulq8\/image\/upload\/v1622644688\/artworks_rijk\/43_4_gmbk1y.png"],"indexf":69},"84":{"index":84,"Name":"Vecchietta","birth":1412,"death":1480,"timeline_position":1446,"timeline_position_extended":1441.0,"Wikipedia":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Vecchietta","Summary":"Lorenzo di Pietro, known as Vecchietta, was an Italian Sienese School painter, sculptor, goldsmith and architect of the Renaissance.

He apparently became known as <i>Verrocchio<\/i> after the surname of his master, a goldsmith. Few paintings are attributed to him with certainty, but a number of important painters were trained at his workshop. His pupils included Leonardo da Vinci, Pietro Perugino and Lorenzo di Credi. His greatest importance was as a sculptor and his last work, the Equestrian statue of Bartolomeo Colleoni in Venice, is generally accepted as a masterpiece.<\/p>","cloudinary thumbnails":"https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/dfyzsulq8\/image\/upload\/v1622639726\/thumbnails2\/thumbnail_113_yqtex6.png","final artworks":["https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/dfyzsulq8\/image\/upload\/v1622639726\/thumbnails2\/thumbnail_113_yqtex6.png","https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/dfyzsulq8\/image\/upload\/v1621499134\/artworks\/113_2_op5kqb.png","https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/dfyzsulq8\/image\/upload\/v1621499134\/artworks\/113_1_u8nm2w.png","https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/dfyzsulq8\/image\/upload\/v1621499134\/artworks\/113_4_hqtcoj.png","https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/dfyzsulq8\/image\/upload\/v1621499134\/artworks\/113_0_i5aj5z.png","https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/dfyzsulq8\/image\/upload\/v1621499134\/artworks\/113_3_yiah95.png","https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/dfyzsulq8\/image\/upload\/v1622644688\/artworks_rijk\/113_2_lmj6fy.png","https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/dfyzsulq8\/image\/upload\/v1622644688\/artworks_rijk\/113_3_l9tkpz.png","https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/dfyzsulq8\/image\/upload\/v1622644688\/artworks_rijk\/113_1_rwhple.png"],"indexf":84},"71":{"index":71,"Name":"Paolo Romano","birth":1445,"death":1470,"timeline_position":1458,"timeline_position_extended":1458.0,"Wikipedia":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Paolo_Romano","Summary":"Paolo Romano, also known as Paolo Tuccone and as Paolo di Mariano di Tuccio Taccone was an Italian early Renaissance sculptor and goldsmith.
