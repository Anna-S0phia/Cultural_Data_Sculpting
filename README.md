# Cultural Data Sculpting
eM+ / experimental Museology at EPFL 

The code in this repository was made to build a timeline visualisation of Giorgio Vasari's "Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects" (1568). The visualisation was my final project for the Cultural Data Sculpting course, given by Sarah Kenderdine at EPFL (eM+ lab) in 2021 and is available under the following link: https://cables.gl/p/uLiDbC .
